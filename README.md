# 💻 Workstation

Welcome to the **`workstation`** branch of the ⚓ Dockyard — the configuration for my primary Windows PC, used for both gaming and personal projects.

This branch contains the customization, assets, and automation that make my daily workflow smooth and my setup visually appealing. From Rainmeter dashboards to handy macros, it's all here in one place.
